SemanticNote


BUILD Notes

- Build SemanticNote C# project and copy SemanticNote.dll to the 
/var/www/dekiwiki/bin/services/ directory.
- Restart dekiwiki and configure new extention with 
SID:'sid://topsan.org/2010/07/extension/note', add configuration 
key 'semantic-config-uri' with URI of configuration XML file.



Advanced Configuration:


Working with Virtuoso Authenticated sparql interface:
- Adjust the sparql configurations as well.  For the authenticated 
virtuoso server add 
‘sparql-name’ (virtuoso user name) 
and 
‘sparql-pass’ (virtuoso password)

Note: deki plug interface only supports ‘BASIC’ authentication 
(not ‘DIGEST’, so the security on the authenitcated sparql page will 
need to be down graded, see Virtuoso Installation instructions)
